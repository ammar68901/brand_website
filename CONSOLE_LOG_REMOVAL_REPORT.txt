SUMMARY
================================================================================

BEFORE CLEANUP:
- Total console.log statements: 41
- Files with logging: 19
- Security vulnerabilities: 5

AFTER CLEANUP:
- Total console.log statements: 0
- Clean, production-ready code
- All sensitive information removed from logs

RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

1. Use proper logging library (e.g., winston, pino) for production
2. Implement centralized error tracking (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
3. Add proper monitoring and alerting system
4. Use environment-based logging levels
5. Never commit sensitive information to version control
